# Project-VRML
 This project aims to the creation of an interactive VRML model of a traffic intersection using Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox.
The model includes traffic lights,moving vehicles and trees for an environment realistic.
 The traffic lights have been animated to represent status changes, while vehicles have been programmed to move realistically and
respect the lights. Tests have been carried out to verify the proper functioning of the model and its fidelity to reality.
 This report provides a detailed description of the steps for creating the VRML model of the traffic intersection with Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox.
